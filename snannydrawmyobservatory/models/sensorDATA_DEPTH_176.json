Typical application accuracy of 0.01% is achieved even under difficult environmental conditions. Desirable characteristics include excellent long-term stability, 1 x 10e-8 resolution, low power consumption, and high reliability.\r\nThe remarkable performance of these depth sensors is achieved through the use of a precision quartz crystal resonator whose frequency of oscillation varies with pressure-induced stress. A quartz crystal temperature signal is provided to thermally compensate the calculated pressure and achieve high accuracy over a broad range of temperatures. The depth sensors include waterproof housings with integral shock protection.\r\nHigh accuracy, resolution, and stability make Digiquartz® Depth Sensors ideal for applications such as Tsunami detection, wave and tide gauges, platform leveling, underwater pipe laying, and as depth sensors in ROVs and AUVs.\r\nAll Depth Sensor ranges are available with either frequency outputs or integral intelligent electronics with bi-directional digital communications.","uuidModel":"ee44dc66-720c-3ca3-87fb-9e8bd4abf85b","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","URI":"sensorDATA_DEPTH_176","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"Series 8CDP","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Paroscientific, Inc.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Max. pressure","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Housing material","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Power supply","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Power consumption","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Size","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
