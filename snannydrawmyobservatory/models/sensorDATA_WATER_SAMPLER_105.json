Each water sampler is made of a tube blocked up at each end by a sphere acting as a ballvalve. The 2 spheres include a nipple. Before sampling, the tube is 100% clear, the 2 spheres being out of the way of the water flow. External closing system, no internal hindrance. When water sampling is over, the 2 spheres are released and seal the tube. When the \\\"BALL TRAPS\\\" is brought back on deck, the air inlet nipple and the water outlet nipple are properly cleaned. Then either air or nitrogen is injected at the upper part and samples water is collected at the bottom part.","uuidModel":"4cd90881-c05d-3955-ae92-0c846e6941b0","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","value":"sensorDATA_WATER_SAMPLER_105","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","value":"BallTrap","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","value":"Technicap","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Sample volume","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Samples per deployment","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. operating depth","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
