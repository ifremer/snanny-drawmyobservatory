Each sample line is independent from others and the tip tube is clamped until sampling time. The sampling lines are directly connected to the sampling bag without going through pumps or valves and the water is taken in by depressurizing the outside of the bag with a pump. Considering the use in the shallow sea, the apparatus has been made small and lightweight so that a small control vessel can easily install and collect it.","uuidModel":"5d644857-eeb3-34b5-b3ec-310cb9119313","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","value":"sensorDATA_WATER_SAMPLER_110","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","value":"NWS-11C5","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","value":"Nichiyu Giken Kogyo Co., Ltd.","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Sample volume","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Samples per deployment","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. operating depth","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
