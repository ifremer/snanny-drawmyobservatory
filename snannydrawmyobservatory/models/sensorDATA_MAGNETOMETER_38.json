The PULSE 12 is the most powerful towed underwater “all metals” detector on the market today. The system has a very large detection envelope with good detection capabilities in salt water and even greater range in fresh water or on land. The Pulse 12 comes with a Control Box, a Search Coil with 150 feet of cable, and a Fish. The Search Coil mounts on the Fish and is towed through the water at 1 - 4 mph. The Control Box has inputs for three Search Coils. Two additional Search Coils can be added at any time and come complete with cable and fish. The additional Coils allow larger areas to be covered. One Fish is towed directly behind the center of the boat and the other Fish are towed to each side of the boat. One, two, or three Fish can be operating at the same time. When using multiple Fish, each has its own controls and meter on the Control Box. An alarm sounds and the meter swings up when any of the Search Coils detect a target. The complete system is powered by two 12 volt batteries. An Altimeter can be attached to the Fish to inform the operator of the distance between the Fish and the bottom. The PULSE 12 is covered by a TWO YEAR WARRANTY.","uuidModel":"edf6f613-402a-3b2e-8c59-1d9ebb937f7b","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"PULSE 12","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"JW Fishers Mfg.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Operating range","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Sensitivity","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Absolute accuracy","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Gradient tolerance","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Heading error","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Sampling rate","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Power requirement","URI":"24 VDC, 8 W","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Communications","URI":"RS232 or Analog Output","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Operating temperature","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Diameter","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"9 kg","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"Administration","name":""}]}}
