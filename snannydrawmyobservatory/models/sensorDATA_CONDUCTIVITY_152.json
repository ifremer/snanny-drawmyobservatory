They are designed to be mounted on the Recording Doppler Current Profiler RDCP 600. Conductivity is a key parameter for in-situ determination of several fundamental physical properties of seawater. Measurements of Conductivity together with Temperature and Depth improves the RDCP 600 virtual sensors, like Salinity and Speed of Sound. These parameters strongely improves the calculated current speed and cell position, making our RDCP 600 a very good CTD instrument when used with the conductivity sensor 4019 and the high accuracy pressure sensor 3187. The Conductivity Sensors 4019A and 4019B are based on an inductive principle. This provides for stable measurement without electrodes that are easily fouled and may wear out in the field. Utilization of miniature components has made it possible to integrate all the required electronics. The output parameter is electrical conductivity in mS/cm, which is sent to the RDCP via the RDCP Internalbus. The sensors are designed to operate down to 6000 meters. Conductivity Sensors 4019A and 4019B are available for Recording Doppler Current Profiler RDCP 600 only.","uuidModel":"36010db6-8833-3a3e-bba5-0a275e2ebf36","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","value":"sensorDATA_CONDUCTIVITY_152","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","value":"Conductivity Sensor 4019A/B","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","value":"Aanderaa Data Instruments Inc.","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Operating depth","value":null,"URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Conductivity range","value":null,"URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Conductivity resolution","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Conductivity accuracy","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature range","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature resolution","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature accuracy","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Sampling interval","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Supply voltage","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Operating temperature","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions (wxdxh)","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
