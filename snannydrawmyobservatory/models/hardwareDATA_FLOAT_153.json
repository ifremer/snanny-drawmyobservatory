The spheres unique combination of light weight and high strength allow for larger ROV payloads and longer AUV survey missions in the worlds deepest diving vehicles and scientific instrument platforms. SeaSpheres™ are cast from high purity alumina (Al2O3), an incredibly strong and lightweight ceramic. If fact, the spheres is so strong and incompressible that their buoyancy actually increases with depth. Alumina is also an excellent electrical insulator, transparent to radio frequencies and virtually inert in caustic environments. The spheres can be manufactured with varying wall thickness’ in order to tailor their weight and strength to mission requirements. SeaSpheres™ are engineered with a seamless design and held to exacting tolerances during manufacturing and testing to insure a long and reliable service life.","uuidModel":"b406679e-a46d-33eb-84be-d47a90d2af4b","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","URI":"hardwareDATA_FLOAT_153","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"SeaSpheres 3.6\"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"DeepSea Power & Light","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Net buoyancy","URI":"0.27 kg","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth","URI":"11000 m","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"Sphere Ø90 mm","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"0.14 kg","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"Alumina and Ceramic","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
