This type of release mechanism was originally developed by Sonardyne for navigation transponders supplied to the offshore industry of which there are now many thousands reliably in service around the world.\r\nExcellent corrosion resistance is achieved by using Super Duplex stainless steel, Ferralium 255. In addition, the Heavy Load DORT is available in different housing lengths and is mechanically compatible with other standard release transponders on the market thus simplifying mechanical integration.\r\nHeavy Load DORTs are controlled using frequency band specific Lightweight Command Units (LCU) which comprise of a dunking transducer connected to either a splash-proof PSION, PC running supplied software or terminal program. For security of operation, a special coding system provides protection against accidental release by noise and acoustic transmissions from other vessels.","uuidModel":"3424ce75-7502-3144-bc64-3d007d8d63b5","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","value":"hardwareDATA_ACOUSTIC_RELEASE_33","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","value":"Heavy Load DORT - Type 8048","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","value":"Sonardyne International Ltd.","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Release load","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=155"},{"name":"Safe working load","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=156"},{"name":"Max. load","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Frequency range","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=159"},{"name":"Battery life","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=160"},{"name":"Dimensions","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
