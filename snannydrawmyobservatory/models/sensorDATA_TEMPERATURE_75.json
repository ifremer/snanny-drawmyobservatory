The superior performance of the SBE 3F results from its optimized electronic design combined with an extraordinarily precise calibration procedure and quality testing program. The SBE 3F has a time response of approximately 0.07 second, an initial accuracy of 0.001 °C, and is typically stable to 0.002 °C per year. Every SBE 3F is calibrated in Sea-Bird's computer-controlled calibration baths. These superlow-gradient baths produce temperature calibrations with resolution and accuracy not previously available to oceanographers. These sensors can be successfully calibrated as separate modules because they have built-in acquisition circuits and frequency outputs. When used with a CTD system, overall system accuracy is equal to the sensor accuracy degraded only by the uncertainty in the CTD's master clock. A typically small clock error of 1 ppm affords a temperature error of less than 50 &#956;°C.","uuidModel":"4eef9a61-a1c2-3dc2-bc20-8d5cb9824961","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","value":"sensorDATA_TEMPERATURE_75","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","value":"SBE 3F","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","value":"Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc.","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Range","value":"-5 to 35 ºC","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","value":"± 0.001 ºC","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Response time","value":"0.07 s","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","value":"6800 or 10500 m","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Supply voltage","value":"11 - 16 VDC","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Communications","value":"± 0.5V square wave","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Memory","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","value":"Ø48 mm x 270 mm","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","value":"0.63 or 0.9 kg","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","value":"0.28 or 0.55 kg","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","value":"7075 Aluminium or 6AI-4V Titanium","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"Administration","name":""}]}}
