The URC1 cable has been designed specially for unrepeatered systems, benefiting from our past extensive experience in the conception and development of fibre optic cables.\r\nThe cable design is based on a welded steel tube, housing up to 48 fibres in a stress-free environment to ensure a long lifetime.\r\nThe fibres have a defined excess length relative to the tube which is filled with a water-blocking compound. The steel tube offers mechanical and hydrostatic protection and acts as an hermetic barrier against hydrogen for the optical fibres.\r\nA polyethylene sheath is applied over the steel tube to complete the cable core. For electroding purposes (fault location by means of sea electrodes), the cable design can also be offered with a copper conductor fitted over the steel tube.\r\nThe necessary mechanical properties of this URC1 cable family are adapted for each application. Different structures external to the steel tube, such as the number and diameter of armour wires, differ according to different water depths, seabed topology and the degree of protection needed. Two layers of polypropylene yarn outer servings, flooded in bitumen, are applied over the armouring to provide corrosion protection.\r\n\r\nThe URC1 cable family and associated joints are designed to perform reliably for at least 25 years. The URC1cables are also qualified for use with the UQJ.\r\n\r\nThe cable design ensures that no strain is exerted on the fibres during normal operation. In the case of a cable break, high strains and seawater ingress are limited to a short length, so the majority of the cable remains serviceable.","uuidModel":"448e8a18-5b39-331e-897e-634bc91a78f9","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","value":"hardwareDATA_UNDERWATER_CABLE_118","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","value":"URC1","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","value":"Alcatel-Lucent","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Type","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Core","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Cable diameter","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Bending radius","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Colour","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Weight in air","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Breaking strenght","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Conductor resistance","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Insulation resistance","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Operating voltage","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Capacitance","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Bandwidth","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Impedance","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Attenuation","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Filler","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Shield","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Outer jacket","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
