TR-1050s are calibrated to an accuracy of ± 0.002 °C (ITS-90 and NIST traceable standards). Drift has been measured at better than 0.002 °C/year, and extended temperature ranges are available for temperatures from -40 to +50 °C. Special probes have been supplied to measure up to +300 °C. The thermistors used in the TR-1050 are stable and aged, and are available in three housings. The standard model has a time constant of less than 3 seconds. The optional fast thermistor model has a time constant of less than 0.095 seconds. The third model comes standard in the titanium TR-1050, which has its thermistor embedded in the head of the logger; it has a time constant of less than 20 seconds. 8 MB of Flash memory provides sufficient storage for 2,400,000 samples, which can be taken by a single set of batteries. The two high-powered 3 V lithium cell batteries (CR123A) are standard camera batteries available world-wide, and provide sufficient power for deployments of more than 3 years. There are two casings for the TR-1050: plastic; and titanium. Both models are compact, measuring 230 mm in length and have an outer diameter of 38 mm. The plastic logger weighs 310 g and the titanium 500 g. The depth ratings for the different casings are: 740 m (plastic); 10,500 m (titanium).","uuidModel":"6eaa03b7-a871-3e66-8e7c-5f2b022d03b5","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","value":"sensorDATA_TEMPERATURE_72","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","value":"TR-1050","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","value":"RBR Europe Ltd.","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Range","value":"-5 to 35 ºC (extendable)","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","value":"± 0.002 ºC","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","value":"< 0.00005 ºC","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Response time","value":"<3 s or 0.095 s","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","value":"740 m or 10500 m","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Supply voltage","value":"6 VDC","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Communications","value":"RS232, RS485","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Memory","value":"8 Mbyte Flash (2,400,000 samples)","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","value":"Ø38 mm x 230 mm","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","value":"0.31 or 0.5 kg","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","value":"0.03 or 0.2 kg","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","value":"Plastic or Titanium","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"Administration","name":""}]}}
