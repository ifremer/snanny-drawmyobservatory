Several types are available to meet the customer’s needs. All are single pole double throw.\r\n\r\nStandard Proximity – The switch can be normally open or closed. When a magnet is presented the switch will either open or close the circuit.\r\n\r\nSinking Hall Effect – The sensor is normally closed. When a magnet is present the sensor opens at a very high rate of speed.\r\n\r\nSinking/Sourcing Hall Effect – The switch is normally open and will gradually close as the magnet is brought closer to the switch. This is ideal for lining up two objects.\r\n\r\nLatching Hall Effect – The circuit is closed when a South magnet is present and opens when a North magnet is presented.","uuidModel":"56d47b3f-fdf2-32db-96da-d1881c8f4175","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","URI":"hardwareDATA_UNDERWATER_SWITCH_61","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"Proximity Switches","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"SEACON BRANTNER & ASSOCIATES, INC.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Type","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Min. cycles","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. switch frequency","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Power load","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Configuration, contact","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
