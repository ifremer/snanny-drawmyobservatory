The 3DL3 underwater 3D laser imaging system is latest three dimensional scanning product from Smart Light Devices. The system provides an unrivalled combination of speed, accuracy, flexibility and field-of-view to rapidly capture both large and small objects. The system may be used for both linear and rotational scanning of any subsea object, regardless of shape or materials. The system is housed in a compact, light weight, and robust housing with a depth rating of 4000 m, making it highly suited for use on eyeball ROVs and AUVs. \r\nIn operation the system can be readily use to capture the dimensional data of any physical object, structure or scene and convert the data accurately into a three dimensional computer model. A surface resolutions of 25 micrometers is obtainable using the system.","uuidModel":"ddf5d156-8db1-365d-acf8-ee9449027d01","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","value":"hardwareDATA_LASER_87","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","value":"3DL3","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","value":"Smart Light Devices Ltd.","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Type","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Wavelength","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Laser power","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Power requirement","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Optical port","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Connector","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
