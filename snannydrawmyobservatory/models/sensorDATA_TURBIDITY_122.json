The heavy-duty WQ750 is constructed of 316 stainless steel with scratch-resistant quartz optical lenses to provide a long, dependable service life. The unit ships complete with 42 feet of cable and a wiper actuation board. The WQ750 uses a reliable optical sensing system, which produces an analog signal that is enhanced by on-board temperature and ambient light processing. This robust 4-20 mA analog signal is compatible with a host of monitoring and control systems, and it may be transmitted up 650 feet. The WQ750 is compatible with our PC300 process controller and GL500 dataloggers. The WQ750 maintains its accurate and reliable measurements via a mechanical cleaning device that prevents contamination of the measuring windows. The wiper cycle is controlled by an external contact and allows the WQ750 to match the cleaning cycle to the application. The control board is designed to work with our Global Water GL500 dataloggers.","uuidModel":"746ba381-17d4-348f-b638-ab1af21515e4","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"WQ750","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Global Water","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Turbidity range","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Linearity","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Light source wavelength","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Power supply","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. power consumption","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Internal memory","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Communications","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
