The sensor is ideal for a variety of applications, including river monitoring, stream measurement, reservoir water quality testing, groundwater testing, water and wastewater treatment, effluent and industrial control, and more. In accordance with USEPA Method 180.1 for turbidity measurement, the WQ720 is a 90 degree scatter nephelometer. The sensor directs a focused beam into the subject water. The light beam reflects off particles in the water, and the resultant light intensity is measured by a photodetector positioned at 90 degrees to the light beam. The detected light intensity is directly proportional to the turbidity of the water. The turbidity sensor uses a second light detector to correct for light intensity variations, color changes, and minor lens fouling. For environmental monitoring, simply place the sensor directly in the water and position it where the turbidity is to be monitored. For process monitoring, you can place the sensor into a low-pressure pipe for online monitoring using a standard 1.5\" compression coupler.","uuidModel":"0a7952d4-dd43-3750-be40-006649f6d8f6","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","value":"sensorDATA_TURBIDITY_121","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","value":"WQ720","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","value":"Global Water","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Turbidity range","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Linearity","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Light source wavelength","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Power supply","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. power consumption","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Internal memory","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Communications","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
