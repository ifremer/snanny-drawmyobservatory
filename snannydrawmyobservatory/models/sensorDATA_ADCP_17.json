It measures the ocean current profile while moving and it does it with quality, accuracy, and a great price-performance ratio. With the Nortek VM-Profiler, your marine operations will go faster and you will make operational decisions with better confidence than before. The VM-Profiler works by measuring the Doppler shifted echo from the water below the hull. This Doppler shift is proportional to the water speed relative to the ship. The vessel motion is determined using the ship’s navigation systems, including the required gyro and DGPS. In the software, the vessel motion is removed from the output data, leaving the user with the true ocean currents in ship coordinates or earth coordinates. The VM-Profiler does not depend on \"bottom track\" as the primary means to measure the vessel motion. As a result, the currents in the near-surface region can be determined regardless of the water depth or the water quality. Further, calibration has never been easier. Make two 5-minute runs and press a software button. The VM-Profiler software does all the rest for you.","uuidModel":"06ae1b2c-6a85-3273-9c90-93266f0b9317","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","URI":"sensorDATA_ADCP_17","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"Vessel-Mounted 1000","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Nortek AS","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Frequency","URI":"1000 kHz","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. profiling range","URI":"30 m","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Cell size","URI":"0.4 - 4 m","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Operating depth","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. transmit","URI":"1 Watts","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Blank distance","URI":"0.8 m","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","URI":"1% ± 5 mm/s","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. water velocity","URI":"± 10 m/s","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Number of cells","URI":"20-40, max 128","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. ping rate","URI":"6 Hz","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Transducer","URI":"3 Beam","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Transducer beam angle","URI":"25º","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Housing","URI":"Bronze","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Communication","URI":"RS232 or RS422","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Internal memory","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Transducer assembly diameter","URI":"310 mm","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Housing diameter","URI":"190 mm","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Overall length","URI":"220 mm","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature accuracy","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature range","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Tilt accuracy","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Tilt range","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Compass accuracy","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Compass max. tilt","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"Administration","name":""}]}}
