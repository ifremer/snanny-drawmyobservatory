The superior performance of the SBE 3S results from its optimized electronic design combined with an extraordinarily precise calibration procedure and quality testing program. The SBE 3S has a time response of approximately 0.6 second, an initial accuracy of 0.001 °C, and is typically stable to 0.002 °C per year. Every SBE 3S is calibrated in Sea-Bird's computer-controlled calibration baths. These superlow-gradient baths produce temperature calibrations with resolution and accuracy previously unavailable commercially. These sensors can be successfully calibrated as separate modules because they have built in acquisition circuits and frequency outputs. When used with a data logging system, overall system accuracy is equal to the sensor accuracy degraded only by the uncertainty in the logger's master clock. A typically small clock error of 1 ppm affords a temperature error of less than 50 &#956;°C.","uuidModel":"e1b44d47-8914-3f23-a92f-2a4641ec2658","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","URI":"sensorDATA_TEMPERATURE_77","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"SBE 3S","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Range","URI":"-5 to 35 ºC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","URI":"± 0.001 ºC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","URI":"0.00004 ºC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Response time","URI":"0.06 s","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"3400, 6800 or 10500 m","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Supply voltage","URI":"11 - 16 VDC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Communications","URI":"± 0.5V square wave","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Memory","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"Ø48 mm x 299 mm","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"0.63 or 0.9 kg","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"0.28 or 0.55 kg","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"6061 Aluminium or 7075 Aluminium or 6AI-4V Titanium","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"Administration","name":""}]}}
