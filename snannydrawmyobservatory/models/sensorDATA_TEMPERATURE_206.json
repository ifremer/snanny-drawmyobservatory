It is the first professional temperature sensor to pass the ship hull and measure direct in-situ. All the well-known problematic effects and interferences of measuring at the water intake tubes are removed. On the other hand, the unique design allows a very easy maintenance from inside without leaking water into the ship.  The flange construction can be installed easily in any hull constructions, e.g. innovative carbon materials. The design withstands highest mechanical forces against the hull. The sensor includes a complete signal processing unit and transmits data via a rough RS-232 or RS-485 link. USB interfaces are supported as well. The power consumption was optimized for battery powered systems.","uuidModel":"098d0383-f456-36d5-b6eb-a16dad03a4b4","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","value":"sensorDATA_TEMPERATURE_206","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","value":"Advanced Ocean Temperature Hull Sensor","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","value":"SubCtech GmbH","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Range","value":"-2°C to +36°C","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","value":"± 0,005 °C","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","value":"0,0006 °C","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Response time","value":"0.5s","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","value":"Surface ship hull","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Supply voltage","value":"+10V to +32V","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Communications","value":"RS232 ASCII NMEA-0183","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Memory","value":"no","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","value":"d60mm x 200m","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","value":"2.5kg","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","value":"NA","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","value":"POM, Chopper","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"marx@subctech.com","name":"Stefan Marx"}]}}
