Diodes prevent harmful interactions between the cell groups, and also allow multiple HydroPacks to be safely paralleled (with appropriate cables).\r\nThe output is protected with a 2.5 A resettable fuse. In the event of an overload or short circuit, the fuse will activate and reduce the current to a low level.\r\nOnce the fault condition is removed, the fuse will return to its normal state in a short time.\r\nThe HydroPack case is made from type 316 stainless steel to resist corrosion and safely operate at 800 meters depth. It is also equipped with a pressure relief valve that limits internal pressure build-up in case of a fault condition such as a water leak or gas generation by the batteries.","uuidModel":"4f328b5f-fa85-3219-8a2e-991dfa938406","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","value":"hardwareDATA_UNDERWATER_BATTERY_130","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","value":"HydroPack","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","value":"HOBI Labs, Inc.","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Nominal voltage","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Open voltage","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Min. voltage","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Typical capacity","value":"Continuous Load, 20 C\r\n*50 mA 700 hrs\r\n*500 mA 40 hrs\r\n*1000 mA 17 hrs\r\nIntermittent load, 2 minutes per hour:\r\n*50 mA 2 years\r\n*500 mA 50 days\r\n*1000 mA 22 days\r\n\r\nWith appropriate cabling, multiple HydroPacks can be parelleled for greater capacity.","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. capacity","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. current","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Cell type","value":"20 D Cells","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Operating temperature","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Operating depth","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Connector","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","value":"Diameter: 9 cm (3.5\\\")\r\nLength: 37 cm (14.5\\\"), not including connector.","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","value":"5.3 kg","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","value":"2.5 kg submerged with batteries.","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
