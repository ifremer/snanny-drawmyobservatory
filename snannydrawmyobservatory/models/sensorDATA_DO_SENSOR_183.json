Oxygen can also be used as a tracer in oceanographic studies.\r\nFor environmental reasons it is critical to monitor oxygen in areas where the supply of oxygen is limited compared to demand e.g.\r\n\r\n• In shallow coastal areas with significant algae blooms.\r\n• In fjords or other areas with limited exchange of water.\r\n• Around fish farms.\r\n• In areas interesting for dumping of mine or dredging waste.\r\n\r\nThe AADI Aanderaa Oxygen Optodes are based on the ability of selected substances to act as dynamic fluorescence quenchers.\r\nThe fluorescent indicator is a special platinum porphyrin complex embedded in a gas permeable foil that is exposed to the surrounding water. A black optical isolation coating protects the complex from sunlight and fluorescent particles in the water.\r\nThis sensing foil is attached to a sapphire window providing optical access for the measuring system from inside a watertight housing.\r\nThe lifetime-based luminescence quenching principle offers the following advantages over electro-chemical sensors:\r\n\r\n• Not stirring sensitive (it consumes no oxygen).\r\n• Less affected by fouling.\r\n• Measures absolute oxygen concentrations without repeated calibrations.\r\n• Better long-term stability.\r\n• Less affected by pressure.\r\n• Pressure behaviour is predictable.\r\n• Faster response time.\r\n\r\nThe Oxygen Optode outputs data in AiCaP CANbus and RS-232. The sensor can present the O2 concentration in mM, the Air Saturation in % and the Temperature in °C.\r\nThe SEAGUARD® datalogger and the smart sensor are interfaced by means of a reliable CANbus interface (AiCaP), using XML for plug and play capabilities.\r\nThe smart sensors can be mounted directly on the top end plate of the AADI SEAGUARD® and are automatically detected and recognized.","uuidModel":"90dba87e-0ccc-3f0e-b750-12cd46580cea","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","URI":"sensorDATA_DO_SENSOR_183","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"Oxygen Optode 4835","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Aanderaa Data Instruments Inc.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Max. pressure","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Housing material","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Power supply","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Power consumption","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Size","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Response time","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
