This measurement is known to have a good correlation to the amount of suspended matter in water and can be used to monitor sediment, algae, or particle pollution. It is designed for use together with the Aanderaa Dataloggers or Display Units.\r\n\r\nThe sensor head is cylindrically shaped, molded in Durotong and installed in an adapter made of Titanium. The sensor is furnished with a 10-pin receptacle for connection to the sensor cable. Two light emmiting diodes and one photo diode are pointing towards a common center at an angle of 15°. The photodiode is furnished with a daylight filter. The electronic circuitry is molded in the sensor housing.\r\n\r\nWhen a measurement is taken the IR light emitting diode is switched on for half a second and sends a light beam into the water. If the surrounding water is clean and clear the photodiode will not detect this light. On the other hand, if the water is contaminated, scattered light from particles in the water will be sensed by the photodiode and a photocurrent will flow in the diode. This current gives a signal that signifies the amount of light that has been scattered. The signal is independent of the ambient light intensity and it is fully temperature compensated.\r\n\r\nThe output is in the standard Aanderaa SR-10 format. The adapter also has a temperature probe measuring the exact water temperature and the output is in the standard Aanderaa VR22 format.\r\n\r\nThe sensor is designed to avoid marine fouling. In any case, it is important to keep the plastic surfaces, covering the IR-LED and the photodiode, clean to ensure accurate measurements. When exposed to air, the sensor should read 0.1 NTU.","uuidModel":"d5a80046-2002-36ef-b513-5d7b51b3e9fa","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","value":"sensorDATA_TURBIDITY_85","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","value":"Turbidity Sensor 3712","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","value":"Aanderaa Data Instruments Inc.","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Turbidity range","value":"0 – 20 NTU;\r\n0 – 100 NTU;\r\n0 – 500 NTU;","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","value":"2% of full scale","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Linearity","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Light source wavelength","value":"880 nm","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","value":"200 m","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Power supply","value":"9 VDC","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. power consumption","value":"0.15 mA","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Internal memory","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Communications","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","value":"Ø40 x 159 mm","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","value":"0.385 kg","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","value":"0.196 kg","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","value":"Hostaform, Durotong, Titanium","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"Administration","name":""}]}}
