The system measures five parameters, including temperature, salinity (conductivity), depth, chlorophyll and turbidity, with a rechargeable battery and a memory. The system can be pre-programmed to close sampling bottles at the desired depths so that it does not require any special winches and real-time communication cables. The system design is small and light. The CTD with water samplers can be operated by a small boat with a winch of a capacity of approximately 150kg or greater.","uuidModel":"f94147a1-29e6-3010-abea-2c4a99d2cf99","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"Water Sampler with CTD","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"JFE Advantech Co., Ltd.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Sample volume","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Samples per deployment","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. operating depth","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
