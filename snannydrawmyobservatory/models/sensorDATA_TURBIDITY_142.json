Available ranges are 40 NTU, 100 NTU, 400 NTU and 1,000 NTU, which can be set by the user. Currently there are four probes available in the ANALITE 390 series, namely the NEP390, NEP391, NEP395 and NEP396. Specifically the NEP390 and NEP391 probes are designed for applications where bio fouling will not be a problem such as short monitoring deployment or placement in fast and cold running water. The NEP395 and NEP396 probes however, with their integral wiper assembly, are designed where bio-fouling or sedimentation build-up is likely. Wiping can be initiated automatically (periodically), via a direct RS232 command or manually as required. The ANALITE 390 series probes may be operated at depths of up to 100 meters (approx. 330 feet). All ANALITE 390 series probes use 90Â° optics and employs infrared light in accordance with ISO7027. All probes use a unique modulation technique that ensures almost total rejection of fluctuating ambient light conditions. The probes may be calibrated at any time or have later firmware uploaded by the user via the RS232 interface. Two cable connection systems are available. The standard version employs a marine grade connector to terminate the cable to the probe, whereas the G version has the cable permenantly connected to the probe via a waterproof gland.","uuidModel":"b68abe53-6879-3689-8283-ad1fc168ef56","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"NEP390 Series Intelligent Turbidity Probes","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"McVan Instruments Pty Ltd.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Turbidity range","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Linearity","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Light source wavelength","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Power supply","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. power consumption","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Internal memory","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Communications","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
