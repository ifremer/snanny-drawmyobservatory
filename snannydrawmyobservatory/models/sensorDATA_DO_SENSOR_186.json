A black optical isolation coating protects the complex from sunlight and fluorescent particles in the water.\r\nThis sensing foil is attached to a window providing optical access for the measuring system from inside a watertight titanium housing.\r\nThe foil is excited by modulated blue light, and the phase of a returned red light is measured (see illustration overleaf).\r\nBy linearizing and temperature compensating, with an incorporated temperature sensor, the absolute O2 concentration can be determined.\r\nThe lifetime-based luminescence quenching principle offers the following advantages over electro-chemical sensors:\r\n\r\n• Not stirring sensitive (it consumes no oxygen)\r\n• Less affected by fouling\r\n• Measures absolute oxygen concentrations without repeated calibrations\r\n• Better long-term stability\r\n• Less affected by pressure\r\n• Pressure behaviour is predictable\r\n• Faster response time.\r\n\r\nThe sensor is designed to operate down to 300 meters. It fits directly on to the top end-plate of Recording Current Meter RCM 9, and other Aanderaa instruments.","uuidModel":"9cb6b017-3a65-3dcc-8018-b33dd0b287b8","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"Oxygen Optode 4175","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Aanderaa Data Instruments Inc.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Max. pressure","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Housing material","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Power supply","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Power consumption","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Size","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Response time","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
