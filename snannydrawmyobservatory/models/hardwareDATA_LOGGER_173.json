During the collection of data the pre-processing validated already the values and passes quality-evaluated data records on according to ISO to back-end systems. Data can be stored up to 5 years continuously highly solvent on a 2GB CompactFlash (CF) memory card. Over a data transmission telemetry (RS-232 or optionally RS-485, GSM, WLAN, Ethernet, Bluetooth, IRIDIUM, Radio etc.) data are transmitted automatically on-line or at given times. \r\nWith the SmartDI different sensors and measuring systems, e.g. CTD probes or Meteorology’s can be operated. In addition up to 36 serial interfaces as well as digitally or analogue in- or outputs can be used. With the integrated quick look function as well as extensive configuration and diagnostic menus a user-friendly man-machine interface is realized. The modular structure makes a simple and economical adjustment possible to the most diverse applications, which is extensively expandable.","uuidModel":"4b54879f-20ae-3a0d-8d9d-40c55e4ae6f2","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","value":"hardwareDATA_LOGGER_173","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","value":"Advanced FerryBox SmartDI controller","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","value":"SubCtech GmbH","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Depth rating","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Housing material","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Size","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Data storage capacity","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Time base stability","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Power supply","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Power consumption","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature range","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"marx@subctech.com","name":"Stefan Marx"}]}}
