With a range of ±3 degrees and pressure rating of 3 MPa, the tiltmeter is suitable for applications such as:\r\n\r\n•  Monitoring the behavior of the concrete face of rockfill dams\r\n•  Monitoring rotation of piers, piles, and retaining walls\r\n\r\nThe deep-water tiltmeter consists of an electrolytic tilt sensor housed in a heavy brass enclosure.\r\nThe tiltmeter mounting surface should be horizontal and flat. If the tiltmeter is to be mounted on an inclined surface, a horizontal mounting shelf should be constructed. Two anchors are installed in the structure and the tiltmeter is fastened to the anchors.\r\nSince signal cable will be subjected to the same pressure as the tiltmeter, it must be encased in waterproof conduit that has the same pressure rating as the tiltmeter. Continuous tubing is recommended.\r\nTilt readings are obtained with a data logger or a portable readout. Readings are in volts and are converted to angles by applying conversion factors. Changes in tilt are found by comparing the current reading to the initial reading.\r\nThe deepwater tiltmeter has a very narrow range, so it is necessary to \\\"null\\\" the sensor at installation time. This provides the maximum measurement range and also takes advantage of the sensor\\'s best characteristics. The EL Nulling Device or the EL Data Recorder are convenient tools for the nulling operation.","uuidModel":"c7a19d48-affd-3600-8940-e48040bb8234","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"EL Deep-Water Tiltmeter","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Durham Geo Slope Indicator","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Type","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Angular range","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Scale factors","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Repeatability","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Linearity","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature coefficient","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Time constant","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Tilt output","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Power","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Operating temperature","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Size","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Material","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
