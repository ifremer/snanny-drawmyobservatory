Type 5807 is a 5,000 metre depth rated flotation collar designed specifically for use with Sonardyne’s range of Directional Compatt 5 and DPT acoustic transponders. It has improved hydro-dynamic properties, permitting a 50% faster speed of ascent then earlier models, saving vessel time. The unique shape of the Type 5807 flotation collar allows a transponder to be installed such that the unit is acoustically shielded from localised noise interference and also afforded increased protection from accidental physical damage whilst deployed. Each float assembly comes in two halves and is clamped around a Compatt or DPT transponder using stainless steel fixings. Bright colours ensure good visibility, either when viewed underwater from an ROV’s camera or when on the surface prior to recovery.","uuidModel":"73b9f87b-d6b9-32e2-96d2-4db63d7ba5d1","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","URI":"hardwareDATA_FLOAT_157","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"Compatt/ DPT Flotation Collar - 5870","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Sonardyne International Ltd.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Net buoyancy","URI":"35 kg","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth","URI":"5000 m","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"650 x 500 x 500 mm","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"61 kg","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"Polyurethane","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
