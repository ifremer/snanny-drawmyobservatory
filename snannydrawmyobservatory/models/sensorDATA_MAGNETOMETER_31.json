A PVC nose cone protects it from side impacts, while maintaining a streamlined tow body. We have never lost a SeaSPY from the connector, except for the time someone threw one overboard without connecting it to the cable. While there’s some human error no mag can account for, the story has a happy ending: the customer went back a year later and found their SeaSPY in working condition. SeaSPY’s sleek design resists snags.e inexpensive and field replaceable tailfins are the only protruding element, and they are designed to snap off should they ever get snagged on rocky outcroppings. The SeaSPY towfish is made of ¼\" super strong fiberglass coated with a ‘bumper’ layer of polyurethane for extra shock absorption. Should even a drop of water penetrate the towfish, a leak detector warning appears on your screen to inform you. Call us overprotective, but in the event of a breach, SeaSPY’s electronics module is encased in a polycarbonate housing with ‘O’ ring seals for another layer of security. The sensor itself is suspended on shockmounts to ensure the quality of your data isn’t influenced even if you drag SeaSPY along the sea floor.","uuidModel":"f35792fa-2883-38ca-b378-4fba03239bbd","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","value":"sensorDATA_MAGNETOMETER_31","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","value":"SeaSPY","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","value":"Marine Magnetics Corp.","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Operating range","value":"18000 to 120000 nT","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Sensitivity","value":"0.01 nT/√Hz","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","value":"0.001 nT","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Absolute accuracy","value":"0.1 nT","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Gradient tolerance","value":"> 10000 nT/m","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Heading error","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Sampling rate","value":"0.1 to 4 Hz","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","value":"300, 1000, 3000 or 6000m","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Power requirement","value":"15 - 35 VDC or 100 - 240 VAC, 3W","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Communications","value":"RS232","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Operating temperature","value":"-45 to 60 ºC","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Diameter","value":"Ø127 x 1240 mm","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","value":"16 kg","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","value":"2 kg","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"Administration","name":""}]}}
