The 39 is intended for moorings or other long-term, fixed-site applications, as well as shorter-term deployments on nets, towed vehicles, or ROVs. Calibration coefficients are stored in EEPROM, and uploaded data is in ASCII engineering units (°C and decibars). The 39’s thermistor, the same sensor used in the SBE 16plus V2 SEACAT and 37 MicroCAT, has a long history of exceptional accuracy and stability; drift is typically less than 0.002 °C per year. Two configurations are offered:\r\n• Thermistor embedded in titanium endcap (25-second time constant), for rugged conditions.\r\n• External thermistor in pressure-protected sheath (0.5-second time constant), for fast sampling.\r\nThe 39’s optional Druck pressure sensor employs a micro-machined silicon diaphragm in which the strain elements are implanted with semiconductor fabrication techniques. Unlike metal diaphragms, silicon’s crystal structure is perfectly elastic, so the sensor is essentially free of pressure hysteresis. Compensation of temperature influence on pressure offset and scale is performed by the 39’s CPU.","uuidModel":"c2b43566-97e5-3136-a763-2e24383718f4","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","URI":"sensorDATA_TEMPERATURE_82","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"SBE 39","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Range","URI":"-5 to 35 ºC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","URI":"± 0.002 ºC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","URI":"0.0001 ºC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Response time","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"600 or 10500 m","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Supply voltage","URI":"9 - 30 VDC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Communications","URI":"RS232","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Memory","URI":"64 Mbyte non-volatile FLASH\r\n(32,900,000 bytes usable)","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"Ø48.2 mm x 350.6 mm","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"0.6 or 1.2 kg","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"0.25 or 0.7 kg","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"0.25 or 0.7 kg","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"Administration","name":""}]}}
