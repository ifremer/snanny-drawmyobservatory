The principle of measurement used makes it independent from electrical fields and magnetic effects. It's absolutely linear slope within the whole measuring range gives an easy adaptation to existing firmware. Using comparably large dimensions for the conductivity cell leads to long unattended measuring times, as biological activity at the sensor has only small degrading effects. The sensor's housing is made of titanium and is pressure resistant up to 500 dbar making it ideally suited for long time monitoring systems even at corrosive environments. The connection of the sensor to the data acquisition system is done by a multi-core sea cable for power supply and analogue voltage.","uuidModel":"0e11701f-4b83-38ae-ade8-5c46108279d5","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","value":"sensorDATA_CONDUCTIVITY_162","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","value":"SST Conductivity Sensor","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","value":"Sea & Sun Technology GmbH","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Operating depth","value":null,"URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Conductivity range","value":null,"URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Conductivity resolution","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Conductivity accuracy","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature range","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature resolution","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature accuracy","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Sampling interval","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Supply voltage","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Operating temperature","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions (wxdxh)","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
