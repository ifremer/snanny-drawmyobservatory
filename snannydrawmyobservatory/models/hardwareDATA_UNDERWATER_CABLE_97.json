Previously, all 75 Ohm coax had either a solid conductor with short flex life or a foam dielectric which is unacceptable underwater due to compression at depth. Until now, the only alternatives to traditional solid-conductor 75 Ohm coax was 50 Ohm coax for video applications, or a tiny 75 Ohm coax with a #30 AWG conductor which is very delicate. Video equipment operators use our high performance cable to provide the electrical connection between an underwater video camera and its control unit. The cable can also be used to distribute power to lighting, and pan and tilt.\r\n\r\nOur cable, with its modified heavy-duty RG-59 type coax, includes #16 AWG or #18 AWG cross-linked insulated conductors. The coax is available separately with a neoprene jacket for coax only applications.","uuidModel":"9d8a88e5-3522-3e12-bc12-945d7906d23f","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","value":"hardwareDATA_UNDERWATER_CABLE_97","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","value":"Underwater Video Cable","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","value":"Burton Electrical Engineering","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Type","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Core","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Cable diameter","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Bending radius","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Colour","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Weight in air","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Breaking strenght","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Conductor resistance","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Insulation resistance","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Operating voltage","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Capacitance","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Bandwidth","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Impedance","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Attenuation","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Filler","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Shield","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Outer jacket","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
