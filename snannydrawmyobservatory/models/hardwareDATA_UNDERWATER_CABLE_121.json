The OALC4 cable has been designed specially for repeatered systems, benefiting from our past extensive experience in the conception and development of submarine fibre optic cables. \r\nThe cable design is based on a welded steel tube, housing up to 12 fibres in a stress-free environment to ensure a long lifetime.\r\nAt the heart of the cable is the fibre unit structure where the optical fibres are set in a steel tube and are protected by a jelly from water penetration.\r\nThe composite conductor is composed of the fibre unit structure protected by a very high-strength steel wire vault, surrounded by a seam-welded copper tube swaged onto the steel wires.\r\nLongitudinal watertightness is provided by a water-blocking material.\r\nThe composite conductor is insulated with high-density polyethylene. The insulation also provides abrasion resistance (four times more resistant than conventional insulants). This structure is used for deep-sea deployment and is our lightweight cable (LW) type.\r\nThe OALC4 cable may be used at any sea depth between 0 and 8000 meters for the 1.6 ohm/km version and between 0 and 7000 meters for the 1.0 ohm/km version.\r\nArmoured cables use the deep-sea cable (LW) structure, and additional protection is provided according to the conditions and nature of the seabed.","uuidModel":"260f16ae-1095-3c57-8fd8-3de86aea1ba7","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","value":"hardwareDATA_UNDERWATER_CABLE_121","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","value":"OALC4","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","value":"Alcatel-Lucent","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Type","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Core","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Cable diameter","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Bending radius","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Colour","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Weight in air","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Breaking strenght","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Conductor resistance","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Insulation resistance","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Operating voltage","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Capacitance","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Bandwidth","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Impedance","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Attenuation","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Filler","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Shield","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Outer jacket","value":"","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
