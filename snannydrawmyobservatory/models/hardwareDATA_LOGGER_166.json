Weather,\r\ncurrent and water quality parameters from multiple sensors may\r\nbe included.\r\nPower management & telemetry options are also incorporated\r\nto enable real time transmission of data directly to the userâ€™s\r\ndesktop. As a back up, the data stored in flash memory may\r\nbe retrieved from the DBC-2 when the unit is taken off line for\r\nservice.\r\nThe entry level DBC-2 is housed in an IP65 enclosure size\r\n90x145x225mm with LEMO environmental series K connectors.\r\nThe mating LEMO connectors are designed to enter the external\r\nhousing of a data buoy superstructure through water tight\r\nglands to provide a simple field installation of all cabling, thus\r\navoiding any custom work on the part of the user. The DBC-2\r\nhardware may contain a combination of serial data and analogue\r\ncards to connect to external sensors. The entry level enclosure\r\nsupports up to 12 channels, but larger enclosures housing\r\nhigher numbers of interface cards are available. Serial cards are\r\ncontrolled by the RBR metatable software (see reverse of data sheet) and analogue cards may be selected from a range of\r\nstandard interfaces.","uuidModel":"d3b3de32-47df-3121-ac2a-35086eb1c003","custom":{"identifier":[{"name":"code","value":"hardwareDATA_LOGGER_166","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"classifier":[{"name":"model","value":"DBC-2","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","value":"RBR Europe Ltd.","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Depth rating","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Housing material","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Size","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Data storage capacity","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Time base stability","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Power supply","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Power consumption","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature range","value":"-","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"info@rbr-global.com","name":""}]}}
