For seawater, the ability to conduct electrical current is mostly dependent on temperature and the amount of inorganic dissolved solids. This means that, together with temperature and depth information, a good estimate of the salinity may be determined. Salinity is defined as the concentration of dissolved solids. The Conductivity Sensors are based on an inductive principle. This provides for stable measurement without electrodes that are easily fouled and may wear out in the field. Utilization of miniature components has made it possible to integrate all the required electronics. A digital signal processor calculates salinity, density and speed of sound. The salinity and density are calculated according to the UNESCO International Equation of State (IES 80). The Conductivity Sensor 3919/3919IW outputs data in both RS-232 and Aanderaa SR10 format. 4119 outputs SR10 format, while 4120IW has analog output as well as RS-232. All three sensors are available in A and B versions; version B has enhanced accuracy compared to version A. Additionally, sensor 3919 is available in two depth ratings as well: 6000 m (3919) and 2000 m (3919 IW; Intermediate Water). Refer specifications on next page. On the RS-232 output the Conductivity in mS/cm, as well as Temperature, Salinity, Density and Speed of sound may be presented. Two SR10 channels are available; one of the SR10 outputs can be configured to present Conductivity, Salinity, Density or Speed of Sound, while the other SR10 output presents the temperature measurement. The user may configure the range on both SR10 outputs. This allows for a possibility to zoom in on the range of interest. Conductivity Sensor 3919 is designed to operate down to 6000 meters, 3919 IW is designed to operate down to 2000 meters, while 4119 and 4120IW are designed to operate down to 1000 m. The Conductivity Sensors are available for Recording Current Meters RCM 9, RCM 9 MkII, RCM 9 IW, RCM 9 LW and RCM 11, Recording Doppler Current Profiler RDCP 600 as well as a stand-alone RS-232 sensor for other applications.","uuidModel":"fb884d59-15ad-3386-88ee-a21d581a0be6","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"Conductivity Sensor 3919IW","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Aanderaa Data Instruments Inc.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Operating depth","URI":null,"Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Conductivity range","URI":null,"Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Conductivity resolution","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Conductivity accuracy","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature range","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature resolution","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature accuracy","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Sampling interval","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Supply voltage","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Operating temperature","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions (wxdxh)","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
