It is strongly fixed to the instrument carrier while the ground weight is hung up to the release hook. After the research period an acoustic signal is sent down to the instrument and the releaser opens the hook. The release optionally can also be effected with an integrated timer. Then the timer batteries provide the motor with power. Additionally the releaser is able to head for external instruments and to send replies to the deck unit. The releaser is available in lightweight version KUMQUAT K/MT 562 and in heavy load version KUMQUAT K/MT 552. Both are also for sale as in-line-releaser, i. e. they are equipped with two side bars for mooring mounting: lightweight K/MT 573 and heavy load K/MT 572.","uuidModel":"075539a5-25d4-3513-b842-c5d2e5ab66d7","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"KUMQUAT K/MT 552","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"K.U.M.
