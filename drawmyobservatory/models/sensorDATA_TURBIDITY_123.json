The meter is provided with a padded carrying case and 10’ of marine grade cable, with lengths up to 100’ available upon request. In accordance with USEPA Method 180.1 for turbidity measurement the sensor is a 90 degree scatter nephelometer where a focused beam is directed into the monitored water. The light beam reflects off particles in the water, and the resultant light intensity is measured by a photodetector positioned at 90 degrees to the light beam. The detected light intensity is directly proportional to the turbidity of the water. The WQ770 sensor utilizes a second light detector to correct for light intensity variations, color changes, and minor lens fouling. All turbidity meters are factory calibrated to the highest standards and should not need recalibration for 6-12 months. User calibration, when required, is very easy using the step-by-step scaling process within the display unit.","uuidModel":"d5a273c6-8971-34ca-98d4-a15d87252c0f","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"WQ770","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Global Water","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Turbidity range","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Linearity","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Light source wavelength","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Power supply","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. power consumption","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Internal memory","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Communications","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
