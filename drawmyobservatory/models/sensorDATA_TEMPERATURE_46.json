The sensor is based on a thermistor bridge. A Digital Signal Processor controls the sampling of the bridge and calculates the calibrated temperature in engineering units. The sensor is housed in a rugged titanium cylinder. When mounted onto an AADI ®SEAGUARD Platform, the sensor output signal is by defualt engineering data. Raw data can be selected as additional output. Temperature sensor 4060 can be mounted directly on the top end plate of the AADI ®SEAGUARD Platform. The sensor is automatically detected and recognized by the ®SEAGUARD. Sensor data is also available as RS232 output when used as stand alone sensor in integration with other dataloggers. The 10-pin receptacle in the sensor foot mates with AADI Aanderaa Plug 3216A giving access to RS232 output. For connection to a Personal computer (PC) the 1.5-meter (4.921 ft) Sensor Cable 3855 can be used. It is furnished with a watertight 10-pin plug at the sensor end. An additional USB plug is used for providing power to the sensor. The distance from the PC can be extended to 15 meters by using a Cable Coupler 3472 and a standard Connecting Cable 3282 with watertight titanium plugs.","uuidModel":"288bfb37-bca2-3fc2-ba12-f97baec74279","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"Temperature Sensor 4060","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Aanderaa Data Instruments Inc.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Range","URI":"-4 to 36 ºC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","URI":"±0.03 ºC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","URI":"0.001 ºC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Response time","URI":"<2 s","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"Shallow Water (SW): 0 - 300 m\r\nIntermediate Water (IW): 0 - 2000 m\r\nDeep Water (DW): 0 - 6000 m","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Supply voltage","URI":"6 - 14 VDC","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Communications","URI":"AiCaP CANbus, ASCII RS232","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Memory","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"Ø36 mm x 76 mm","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"0.12 kg","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"Titanium and Epoxy coating","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"Administration","name":""}]}}
