Diodes prevent harmful interactions between the cell groups, and also allow multiple HydroPacks to be safely paralleled (with appropriate cables).\r\nThe output is protected with a 2.5 A resettable fuse. In the event of an overload or short circuit, the fuse will activate and reduce the current to a low level.\r\nOnce the fault condition is removed, the fuse will return to its normal state in a short time.\r\nThe HydroPack case is made from type 316 stainless steel to resist corrosion and safely operate at 800 meters depth. It is also equipped with a pressure relief valve that limits internal pressure build-up in case of a fault condition such as a water leak or gas generation by the batteries.","uuidModel":"4f328b5f-fa85-3219-8a2e-991dfa938406","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"HydroPack","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"HOBI Labs, Inc.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Nominal voltage","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Open voltage","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Min. voltage","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Typical capacity","URI":"Continuous Load, 20 C\r\n*50 mA 700 hrs\r\n*500 mA 40 hrs\r\n*1000 mA 17 hrs\r\nIntermittent load, 2 minutes per hour:\r\n*50 mA 2 years\r\n*500 mA 50 days\r\n*1000 mA 22 days\r\n\r\nWith appropriate cabling, multiple HydroPacks can be parelleled for greater capacity.","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. capacity","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Max. current","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Cell type","URI":"20 D Cells","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Operating temperature","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Operating depth","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Connector","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"Diameter: 9 cm (3.5\\\")\r\nLength: 37 cm (14.5\\\"), not including connector.","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"5.3 kg","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"2.5 kg submerged with batteries.","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
