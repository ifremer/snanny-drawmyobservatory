It has both receive and transmit functions, unlike similar low-cost release transponders, enabling accurate slant ranges to be measured, release actuation to be confirmed and its position to be accurately determined. \r\nThe LRT is depth rated to 500 metres making it the ideal choice for use in continental shelf waters. Field replaceable alkaline or lithium battery packs give a listening life of 18 months and 52 months respectively. A 'screw-off' release mechanism ensures a positive release action that overcomes any biological growth and all external parts are made of high strength plastics that provide excellent environmental corrosion resistance. \r\nLRTs are controlled using the Type 7967 Surface Command Unit (SCU) comprising a low-cost deck unit and remote transducer on 10 metres of cable. The SCU is initially used to program the acoustic identity of the LRT, test the transponder and load the release nut prior to deployment. Once deployed, the deck unit can measure ranges to the transponder and prior to sending a secure release command, relocate the transponder. The SCU can be controlled via RS232 enabling raw range data to be logged to a PC.\r\nThe transponder is compatible with Sonardyne's ROV-Homer and Homer-Pro target relocation systems. Deployed at a point of interest and weeks or years later, the LRT can be interrogated to provide range and direction guidance to a ROV pilot or diver wishing to home back on to it.\r\nFurthermore, the transponder's exact seabed co-ordinates can be quickly and easily determined using Sonardyne's Prospector system, calibrated from a dGPS positioned vessel. \r\nA rope canister is also available for pop-up buoy applications, with 75, 120 or 160 m lengths of 1200 kg breaking-strain rope.\r\nAs an option, the LRT can give an indication that it is tilted beyond 30Â° from vertical using the acoustic link, allowing warning of incorrect string deployment before leaving the site.","uuidModel":"81eda2c6-978e-3fb3-8931-1f6a4b8c438d","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"LRT - Type 7986","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Sonardyne International Ltd.","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Release load","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=155"},{"name":"Safe working load","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=156"},{"name":"Max. load","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Frequency range","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=159"},{"name":"Battery life","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=160"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
