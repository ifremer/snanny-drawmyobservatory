Four serial ports are RS232 with a hardware handshake. Baud rates up to 230kbps are possible.\r\n\r\nTwo independent DC/DC converters provide a supply voltage of 5V, 8V or 12V to any of the serial ports (routing is software-compatible). Switching off ports can be trigged by the command interface or a configurable schedule.\r\n\r\nMaximum current for each supply voltage is 2A. Optionally, the two DC/DC converters can be parallel-connected with an equivalent supply voltage, this circuit helps increasing the maximal possible sensor supply current in up to 4A.\r\n\r\nThe Port 10 module is primarily intended to be a flexible and powerful multiport data logging and controller solution in buoy based and ocean bottom sensor systems â€“ either standalone or in combination with any of our telemetry systems. Due to the very low current drain, Port 10 is an ideal answer to be used for long-term deployments.\r\n\r\nConnecting Port 10  to our HAM.BASE hydro acoustic modem by a dedicated system bus interface, the combination offers up to 14 serial ports with selectable sensor supply ( 8 x RS232/ RS422/ RS 485 software selectable, 6 x RS 232). This configuration allows up to three different sensor supply voltages to be available simultaneously.\r\n\r\nOur Port 10 firmware, a solid solution to handle special applications not comparable to the common configurable standard firmware, allows a reliable and economic customization in any way.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to ask for further questions.","uuidModel":"e591dea4-d0f6-3883-be8f-3654e3404c46","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"Port 10 - Interface and Data Logging Module","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Develogic GmbH","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Housing material","URI":"Serial Interfaces:\r\n6x high speed 64 byte  FIFO serial ports, individually configurable  to RS 232/422/485 - up to 230kbps\r\n4 x high speed RS232 serial ports - up to 230 kpbs","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight","URI":"2 x independently switchable DC/DC converters for sensor supply, 5V/ 8V/12 V supply voltage\r\n2A max per supply voltage, routable to any of the serial port connectors","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Size","URI":"Diameter 109mm","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Data storage capacity","URI":"SDHC card slot, currently supporting up to 32GB capacity cards with FAT file system\r\n512kByte on volatile FRAM buffer memory","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Time base stability","URI":"Standard 25ppm crystal oscillator time base for low power consumption\r\noptional low power, software temperature sompensated time base < 1ppm drift","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Power supply","URI":"12V to 48V supply voltage","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Power consumption","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Temperature range","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"Jasmin.Asmussen@develogic.de","name":"Jasmin Asmussen"}]}}
