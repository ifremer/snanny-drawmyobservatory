The D-Opto Optical Dissolved Oxygen Transmitters were developed due to the requirements of surface water monitoring programs.  The optical dissolved oxygen transmitter has been specifically designed to meet the demanding requirements of the environmental monitoring and scientific research sectors, providing long term, accurate and reliable dissolved oxygen measurement.  The Optical Dissolved Oxygen Sensor has been successfully used in the wastewater industry for over 10 years and uses field proven solid state optical sensing technology that is highly stable over long periods of time, even in harsh conditions.  The D-Opto Optical Dissolved Oxygen Transmitter has extremely low power requirements, and outputs the data in SDI-12 format making it ideal for incorporation into remote environmental monitoring installations.  Percent saturation values generated by the D-Opto Optical Dissolved Oxygen Sensors are the percentage saturation that would occur if the measured liquid were saturated with air under a standard barometric pressure of 1013 mBar at the same temperature.  4-20mA Optical Dissolved Oxygen Transmitters are available.","uuidModel":"ed4f154e-5099-3351-823a-bb77f76bbacb","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"D-Opto Optical Dissolved Oxygen Sensor","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Global Water","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Max. pressure","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Housing material","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Power supply","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Power consumption","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Size","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Accuracy","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Response time","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Resolution","URI":"-","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
