The ARC-1 is based on a patented instant fusible link mechanism (U.S. patent 7,138,603). A 14 kilowatt jolt of power vaporizes a nickel-chromium wire within a few milliseconds, setting free a simple level arm – the only moving part! With so little to go wrong, the ARC-1 is highly reliable when rigged correctly. The ARC-1 is also designed for volume use, with up to 120 units used by a single customer so far. 4096 ID codes and surface control software with GPS position recording and a data base entry for each release simplifies the management of dozens or hundreds of stations. Acoustic ranging provides the distance to a release prior to trigger, and status reporting indicates if a release indeed has fired. In addition to a deck box, Desert Star also offers an interrogator for ROV mounting, providing a unique means to locate a fouled station or trigger while observing underwater.","uuidModel":"3e74a2d7-9b0e-3a9d-a740-3b6cf595e3d1","custom":{"classifier":[{"name":"model","URI":"ARC-1™","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"manufacturer","URI":"Desert Star Systems LLC","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=52","codespace":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/xml.php?skosTema=40"},{"name":"Release load","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=155"},{"name":"Safe working load","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=156"},{"name":"Max. load","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Depth rating","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=158"},{"name":"Frequency range","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=159"},{"name":"Battery life","URI":"","Ref":"modelData","definition":"http://www.ifremer.fr/tematres/vocab/index.php?tema=160"},{"name":"Dimensions","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in air","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Weight in water","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"},{"name":"Materials","URI":"","Ref":"modelData"}],"contactMetaData":[{"role":"pointOfContact","email":"imbernardo@fc.ul.pt","name":"Ivo Bernardo"}]}}
